Types that lacks helpers currently, that should preferably be implemented:
- T2DPointArray
- T2DIntArray
- T2DExtendedArray

Note (July 2016):
1. We should get all functions documented, even a very simple documentation does the trick
   Just so that people have something to refer to.
   
   Currently docs are not hosted anywhere, but we'll get there.
